# DingPy üõé 

A Python package that plays an audio alert when your program finishes, particularly useful for long running batch jobs and impatient developers üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüôã.

## Examples 

```
# first instantiate a dingpy Alarm object
import dingpy

alarm = dingpy.Alarm()
```

To play an alarm at the end of a code block:

```
# a long running block¬†
for i in range(100):
    sleep(1)

alarm.ding()
```

To list all available alarm sounds:

```
alarm.list_alarms()
```

To use a different alarm sound (default is `'bells_tibetan'`): 

```
alarm = dingpy.Alarm(sound='music_box')
alarm.ding()
```

## Alarm Options

`Dingpy` comes pre-loaded with 10 royalty free alarm sounds (downloaded from http://soundbible.com/):

- `'beep'`
- `'bells_tibetan'`
- `'clock_chimes'`
- `'computer_magic'`
- `'house_finch'`
- `'japanese_temple_bell_small'`
- `'music_box'`
- `'old_fashioned_school_bell'`
- `'service_bell'`
- `'tinkle'`

To upload your custom alarm audio (currently only support mp3 format):

```
alarm.upload_alarm(file_path='/local_path/sound.mp3', sound_name='custom-alarm-name') # sound_name needs to be globally unique

# listing all available alarms to confirm upload success
alarm.list_alarms()
```

To delete an uploaded alarm audio file (only user uploaded alarms can be deleted):

```
alarm.delete_alarm('custom-alarm-name')

# listing all available alarms to confirm deletion success
alarm.list_alarms()
```

## Installation 

`DingPy` can be installed via `pip` or `conda`.

```
$ pip install dingpy
$ 
$ conda install dingpy
```

## Future Work

- Support other audio formats
- Support text to speech for speech alert 
- Integrate with `pync` to add notifications to the Mac notification center
- Make this work for jobs running on remote machines
